Orfeoum created based on the Haloferax volcanii DS2 genome from Ensembl: http://bacteria.ensembl.org/Haloferax_volcanii_ds2/Info/Index (`Haloferax_volcanii_ds2.ASM2568v1.dna.toplevel.fa`).

`Haloferax_volcanii_ds2_orfeoum_ATG.gff` contains all ORF starting with ATG with nucleotide length from 15 to 150.

`Haloferax_volcanii_ds2_orfeoum_GTG_TTG.gff` contains all ORF starting with GTG or TTG with nucleotide length from 15 to 150.
